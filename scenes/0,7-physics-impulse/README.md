# Physics Impulse Test Scene

Test scene for the `PhysicsImpulse` SDK component.

A blue cube sits in the center of the parcel with a semi-transparent trigger area around it.
When the player walks into the trigger zone, a physics impulse is applied at ~45 degrees upward with a magnitude of 20, launching the player into the air and forward.

The trigger area changes color from red to green when the player is inside.
