This test scene shows how to use the `InputModifier` SDK component to temporarily block different movement interactions on the main player while inside the scene.

There are several UI buttons on the scene to toggle the different movement interactions separately.

By standing on the moving platform you can test that the avatar positioning is still affected by external factors even when all the movement interactions are blocked.

By clicking the cube at the center of the scene, the scene will trigger an avatar emote, to also test that it doesn't get interrupted while the movement interactions are blocked.
