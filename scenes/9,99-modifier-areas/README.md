This example scene makes usage of `AvatarModifierArea` and `CameraModeArea`.

### SCENE TESTING

Camera Mode Area can be tested with 2 intersected camera mode areas, one for enforcing First Person Camera and the other one for enforcing Third Peron Camera. The clickable cube toggles repositioning one of the areas to the border of the scene to test leaving the scene while inside the area.

Avatar Modifier Area can be tested in the back of the scene, the clickable cube is to toggle adding/removing hardcoded user ids to the excluded lists, currently they have to be configured in the scene code up front.
